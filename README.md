# myFitTreeApp

Visualize your runs through last months with a growing tree simulation.

Using jasonwebb's space colonization algorithm https://github.com/jasonwebb/2d-space-colonization-experiments

Fetching from the Google Fit API data of your running habits from each day.

The tree has 7 branches - each branch - each day of the week.

With every new week, the branches grow longer.

Every new run creates a sub-branch that grows from the day of the run.

Not running at all would grow the branches without sub-branches.

Running  2-3 times a week          |  Not running at all

each running is a sub-branch vertical to the main branch of the day.
