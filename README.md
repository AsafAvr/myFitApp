Visualize your running habits with a growing tree!

Using jasonwebb's space colonization algorithm https://github.com/jasonwebb/2d-space-colonization-experiments

Fetching from the Google Fit API data of your running habits from each day.

The tree grows with 7 branches - each day of the week, if you don't run it would be without sub-branches

run is defined by 30 heart-points a day (at least 30 minutes run)
